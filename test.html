        <h2>Latest Console newsletter</h2>
        <p>Hello! Each week we pick out the most interesting tools for
        developers. We keep track of everything - dev tools, devops, cloud, and
        APIs - so you don't have to.</p>

        <h2>Interesting tools</h2>

        
        <h3><a href="https://www.vantage.sh/">Vantage</a></h3>
        <p><em>AWS Console designed for developers.</em></p>
        <p><strong>What we like</strong>:AWS Console UX is not great; Vantage is much cleaner and faster. It connects using a read-only CloudFormation IAM Role and they have detailed documentation about the read-only permissions it requests. &#34;Views&#34; nicely segment/group resources, even across accounts and regions, with global search for them all. Cost reporting by view and weekly email reports help you manage budgets better.</p>

        <p><strong>What we don't like</strong>: Does not support all AWS products, currently focused on a few key resources e.g. EC2 instances, VPC Subnets, Route53, etc. Currently read-only, which is good for security and because it&#39;s a new tool - plans to add more management features in the future. Also AWS-only, but they are working on other cloud providers.</p>

        <hr />
        
        <h3><a href="https://siasky.net/">Skynet</a></h3>
        <p><em>Decentralized file storage and CDN.</em></p>
        <p><strong>What we like</strong>:Web UI and SDKs for uploading files to a decentralized CDN. Uses a blockchain and rewards users who run nodes with coins which can be exchanged for money. Current average cost = $4.16/TB stored + $1.25/TB transferred.</p>

        <p><strong>What we don't like</strong>: Time to first byte 300-500ms may be prohibitatively slow for some use cases. Streaming &#34;up to 1Gbps&#34; but what does &#34;up to&#34; really mean? Files must be public. Why call it &#34;Skynet&#34;?!</p>

        <hr />
        
        <h3><a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork Search</a></h3>
        <p><em>Fast search for static sites.</em></p>
        <p><strong>What we like</strong>:Generate the index of your content, which is then downloaded by the visitor&#39;s browser and searched using the JS/WASM library &#34;locally&#34; - this is what makes it so fast.</p>

        <p><strong>What we don't like</strong>: Index must be generated manually. It is specifically designed for static sites, so it would need to be hooked into a build process. Would need extra work if you wanted to index a dynamic site.</p>

            from Google</h3>

        <p>We are always on the lookout for interesting tools to feature. We
        only include things that would be of interest to experienced developers
        and do not accept payment for product inclusion. We do not track email
        opens, but do track clicks so we can refine our selection criteria.</p>
